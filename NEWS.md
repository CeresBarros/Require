version 0.0.1
==============

## New features
* This is a rewrite of the function, `Require` which will be removed from package `reproducible`
* This function is intended to be a tool for package management used within a "reproducible" workflow
* It differs from all other attempts at achieving this goal by having the trait that the first and subsequent times the function `Require` is run, the result will be the same.
